However, most patients are not appropriate for self-testing/self-management. Patient education and frequency of testing may be the most important factors. Definitive conclusions about the clinical benefits provided by self-testing/self-management require more rigorously designed trials.  </p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">Oral anticoagulants in the form of vitamin K antagonists, are widely used for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events in various clinical conditions. Long-term use is typically required for high risk groups with particular conditions such as mechanical heart valves, chronic atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial occlusion.(1,2) For many of these indications, a person must continue on oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) lifelong.(3,4) Because of the aging population, and an associated increase in the prevalence of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, it is expected that more patients will need OAT in the future. Evidence suggests that OAT reduces the incidence of thromboembolic complications (venous and arterial thrombosis), and associated mortality and morbidity in these patient populations. (5)</hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5" rend="superscript"> </hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5"> Vitamin K antagonists have a narrow therapeutic window. Excessive anticoagulation confers an increased risk of bleeding, while sub-therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with an increased risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. (6,7)  Unfortunately, the biological effect of the vitamin K antagonists varies between individuals and within an individual over time.(5) For this reason, patients need regular monitoring of OAT with a test known as the international normalized ratio (INR), usually determined in a hospital or outpatient laboratory facility by a venipuncture sample processed in the lab. This can be inconvenient in terms of the blood sampling procedure and of the time spent going for a laboratory test.(1,2)  Point-of-care devices (POCDs) for monitoring long-term OAT were introduced in the 1990s. POCDs are portable and only require a drop of blood from a fingertip puncture. In some countries, such as Germany, self-testing and self-management with POCDs are widely employed, but in most countries uptake has been limited.(8,9)</hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">The POCD </hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">technology makes it possible for patients on long-term OAT to self monitor and self manage their OAT.

Two studies used locally developed satisfaction scales and demonstrated that patients were satisfied using POCDs, but the studies did not do any formal comparisons.(54,59)</hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">The quality score of the 15 studies varied from one to three, with eight attaining a score of three out of a maximum of five (Table 2). Two studies received a score of one. Although no study was double-blinded (it could be argued that this is reasonable, so the maximum quality score would be three), the investigators could minimize potential bias by evaluating outcomes of hemorrhage and thromboembolic events without knowing whether patients underwent POCD testing or laboratory testing. This was done in four studies.(47,53,57,59) Five studies used adequate allocation concealment.(44,45,52,58,59)   Only three studies stated and defined how thromboembolic events would be diagnosed.(52,54,58)  This casts doubt on the accuracy of the recorded number of thromboembolic events. Most studies did define a priori the criteria for major hemorrhage. </hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">To evaluate the potential scope for the use of POCDs, we considered whether they were well tolerated and easily employed. We looked for data on patient eligibility, agreement to consent, and withdrawal from studies. This is most relevant for the 11 studies in which patients were using the POCD for self-management. Three studies did not provide these data.(48,56,58) The studies that did report these data showed the following: </hi></p><list type="unordered"><item><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">For the proportion of patients deemed eligible from a group of consecutive patients, eight studies demonstrated 16% to 40% of patients were deemed unsuitable to use the POCD device, with most studies reporting closer to 40% as unsuitable.</hi></item><item><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">In six of the 11 studies, 18% to 28% of the patients dropped out after being randomized to use the POCD and attempting the training program.</hi></item><item><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">Six studies reported that 12% to 19% abandoned the use of the POCD after the study began, compared with 0% to 6% who withdrew in the routine care groups.</hi></item></list></div><div><head rend="Normal" meTypesetSize="100" meTypesetHeadingID="17"><hi meTypesetSize="100" rend="">Discussion</hi></head><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">Our study reviewed 15 RCTs comparing POCD testing to routine anticoagulation monitoring care in a hospital or laboratory. Of those, 11 compared using POCDs for self-management and self-monitoring with routine anticoagulation monitoring. The latter comparison is the most relevant from the perspective of patient&#8217;s convenience of care, and the data in these trials suggest that POCDs resulted in significantly fewer major thromboembolic events and deaths from any cause. The risk of major hemorrhage was similar between the two groups. These results were unchanged for all subgroup analyses performed. For all analyses, the comparison of percentage time in range between the POCD group and the control group demonstrated superiority with POCD use. Three studies described the use of objective tests to diagnose thromboembolic events.</hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">To test the robustness of the data we performed several subgroup analyses. One included only patients who had been on OAT for &#8805;3 months. We were initially concerned that including patients who were not yet stable on OAT could bias the results against the use of POCDs, given the known interactions with heparin and the difficulty in first achieving INR control.(60) Our subgroup analysis showed that the results were essentially the same, regardless of the time that patients were on OAT at baseline. The odds ratios were also similar whether we included all studies (i.e., any POCD testing compared to routine INR testing) or just self-test plus self-management comparisons. The outcomes were unchanged regardless of who performed the dosing in the POCD groups.</hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">The summary data suggest that POCDs are advantageous. However, in all studies, the frequency of INR monitoring was higher in the POCD group than with routine anticoagulation monitoring. In most cases, the frequency of testing was dictated by the study protocol. It remains unknown whether similar frequent monitoring in routine care would eliminate these differences. It is also unknown whether this rigorous frequency of monitoring using POCDs would persist outside the study setting. In addition, patients who self-manage lose regular contact with their physician. The implications of this are unknown, but based on the critical endpoint of death, it does not seem to be a disadvantage. Of note, is that we calculated o</hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">dds ratios to</hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5"> approximate the relative risk, since the event rates were relatively  &#8220;rare&#8221; (some take this as &lt;10%) so the odds ratio approximation of the relative risk is good. The OR will always be further from the neutral point of 1 than the relative risk (i.e., less conservative), so the results should be interpreted with this in mind.</hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">These findings are subject to certain limitations. First, study methods were not ideal. The highest quality score for any of the publications was three, no study was double-blinded, and in many studies it was impossible to categorize what happened to the withdrawals. In all studies, the withdrawal rates of the POCD testing groups were higher than those of the routine testing groups. In most studies, thromboembolic events were not evaluated in a blinded and objective manner. This introduces the risk that the summary estimates may be biased, but deaths were also statistically significantly less frequent in the POCD group and death is an objective measurement. Secondly, the criteria for patients&#8217; eligibility for inclusion into the individual clinical trials and the high withdrawal rates are such that it is difficult to determine generalizability. It seems that the inclusion-exclusion criteria for the individual trials resulted in the exclusion of many patients deemed unsuitable for POCD self-testing before randomization, in addition to many such patients declining the invitation to participate. Perhaps more importantly, many patients failed to complete POCD training and many who completed training subsequently dropped out. An upper bound of 24% of OAT patients could be eligible for self-testing or self-management with POCD.(36) Consequently, the results of our meta-analysis may only apply to selected patients. Third, the INR test frequency was much higher in the POCD testing strategies; INRs were performed approximately weekly versus monthly in the standard group. It remains unknown whether similar frequent monitoring in routine care would eliminate these differences. It is also unknown whether this rigorous frequency of monitoring using POCDs would persist outside the study setting. Furthermore, the POCD group underwent three two-hour, small group education sessions in most studies whereas no special education was provided to the standard care groups. In addition, patients who self-manage might lose regular contact with their physician. The implications of this are unknown, but based on the critical endpoint of death, it does not seem to be a disadvantage. These limitations make it impossible to determine what effects the frequency of monitoring, patient education, the POCD, or the patient selection may have on the outcomes.(60)</hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">While information on QoL and patients&#8217; satisfaction with the POCDs was collected, we were unable to provide quantitative summary measures of these factors. A qualitative analysis of the data suggests that, in general, patients were at least as satisfied, and some more so, with self-managing using the POCDs than with receiving care at an anticoagulation clinic. These patients were good candidates for using a POCD, having been self-selected or selected by a health care researcher. </hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">This report is not the first systematic review to compare POCD testing with laboratory testing for the management of patients on OAT. Five systematic reviews have been published, but all have limitations.(22,24,61,62)  The most recent analysis by Heneghan </hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5" rend="italic">et al</hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">. suggests that POCD testing resulted in significantly fewer major hemorrhages, thromboembolic events, and deaths than conventional INR testing.(61) The Heneghan analysis, which comprised 14 studies, included three that we considered to be ineligible: one compared POCD testing only with other POCD testing (i.e., inappropriate comparison for their analysis), one did not use POCD test results for OAT management, and the third followed patients for only eight weeks.(21,27,43) Our report also included four articles that were excluded by Heneghan.(45,46,54,58) Finally, the summary data used by these authors reported events per patient enrolled and not by length of follow-up, as we did. As such, the rates we report will be more comparable. Despite this, we came to similar conclusions with respect to two of four outcomes; death and all thromboembolic events. The other authors did not report separately on the more relevant outcome of major thromboembolic events. We did not detect a significant difference between groups for the outcome of major hemorrhage.</hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">Our meta-analysis suggests that using POCDs to manage OAT results in significantly fewer deaths and thromboembolic events and better INR control than laboratory INR testing. Under usual care, warfarin therapy requires regular laboratory monitoring of the INR, coupled with frequent physician-patient contact for dosage adjustment to ensure efficacy and safety.(9) The usual-care method can be cumbersome and inconvenient for the patient and the physician. There is also a potential for dosing errors due to misinterpretation of information conveyed by the physician or delays in contacting the patient.(9)</hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5" rend="superscript"> </hi><hi meTypesetSize="11.5"> This, plus faster test results, more convenience, and more frequent testing, are plausible reasons for the incremental health benefits observed with POCD use.</hi></p><p rend="Normal"><hi meTypesetSize="11.5">Unfortunately, the studies designed to date do not allow a determination of why POCD care is superior. To determine whether it is patient education or frequency of testing that provides superior outcomes requires further randomized controlled trials. Widespread adoption of POCD monitoring at this time would be premature.</hi></p></div><div><cit><quote/></cit></div></div></body></text></TEI>
