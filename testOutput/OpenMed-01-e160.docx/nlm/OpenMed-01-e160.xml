      <title>Part 1: Away</title>
      <p>
        <italic>Tucked away somewhere in the twisting innards of Mulago Hospital,</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>Kampala, Uganda, there lies the pink, neatly stapled medical file of a man</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>who is doomed to die. I know this because I saw him on Thursday night.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>"There's an interesting case you should see if you have time," said the attending doctor</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>cheerfully, "you should look up his condition in your book and take a history. It might </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>be good for a case write-up when you get home."</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>We had just stepped into the casualty department, hoping to catch some of the </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>evening's action. It seemed as though it had found us. Puzzled, one of us asked </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>what the patient in question had.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>"Rabies. He's a classic case." She paused. "But I'm not sure what to do about it."</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>Having had her say, she closed the door to the treatment room behind her, leaving</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>us alone in the crowded hallway.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>~~~~</p>
      <p>We had only been in Kampala for two weeks but already we had seen our fair share </p>
      <p>of 'interesting cases'-- that is to say, we had seen dozens of people whose disease had</p>
      <p>progressed to the point where their clinical findings were evident even to our clumsy hands.</p>
      <p>Young diabetics with histories of multiple DKAs because they could not afford insulin, </p>
      <p>children with spleens swollen from chronic malaria, and wasted people of all ages exhibiting </p>
      <p>the innumerable and tragic complications HIV infection were all daily sites for us in Mulago Hospital.</p>
      <p>At home in Canada, patients would rarely if ever present at such advanced stages. They </p>
      <p>would be considered exceptional. Here, they were the rule.</p>
      <p>To see these patients --cases-- day after day was of course absoultely heart-wrenching. Earlier in our </p>
      <p>training, before we had become comfortable in a clinical setting, any one of the patients </p>
      <p>we now saw hourly would have been recognized only as the individual tragedy it was,</p>
      <p>a unique piece of human suffering.</p>
      <p>Now, on our first major clinical elective, we had already developed a student's enthusiasm for learning</p>
      <p>to accompany our empathetic urges. Foucault would have referred to this as the development of the "medical gaze." </p>
      <p>For us, though, it was not a philosophical construct but the learned, pragmatic response to one of the most real and</p>
      <p>tearing realities of medical education: our learning depends on the willingness of patients to share their suffering with us </p>
      <p>and our ability to occasionally look beyond that suffering and see the scientific principles that lay behind it.</p>
      <p>~~~~</p>
      <p>
        <italic>We stepped into the treatment room like four scared, shocked kittens comically dolled up in white coats. </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>The consultant strode in with confident ease and without pause began to take a history from the patient</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>and his family, trying to piece together their story. None of us foreigners spoke the local Lugandan language, </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>so we had no choice but to wait until the consultant could translate for us. As we watched meekly, the patient, in evident discomfort,</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>lay supine, knees bent, head thrown back, with the freshly healed stigmata of a dog's bite on his distal forearm.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>Soon satisfied with the history, the consultant gave us a quick summary.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>The man had received the bite while defending his daughter from the attack of a wild dog. Thinking </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>nothing of the minor wound on his arm and daunted by the experience and cost of coming to Mulago hospital, </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>he had dismissed the injury until he began to develop his current symptoms of extreme terror, laryngeal spasm, and hydrophobia.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>A classic case.</italic>

        <p>	A uniformly fatal infection, still common in many parts of the tropics, that is caused </p>
      </disp-quote>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>	by the rabies virus... once clinical symptoms have appeared, the patient will die. However,</p>

        <p>	if the infection is caught soon after transmission and before the onset of clinical symptoms, </p>
      </disp-quote>

        <p>	rabies can be prevented by post-exposure vaccination.</p>

      </disp-quote>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>	of rabies infection. In this situation, management is symptomatic with sufficient sedation</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>	and analgesia to relieve pain and terror.</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <disp-quote>

        <italic>The medical plan for the man was continued observation, accompanied by any</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>palliation the hospital resources could afford. We never found out whether or not he was told of his prognosis,</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>or whether any effort would be made to find the daughter and initiate the post-exposure rabies vaccine protocol</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>before it was too late. Such follow-up was not always possible in the chaos of the hospital.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>The consultant volunteered to give us a lift so we wouldn't have to walk home in the dark.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>For four white mzungus it was probably a risk not worth taking. Not even the jostling</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>of his car over the deep potholes of Wandegeya road could shake the image of the bitten man or his story from my head.</italic>

      <p>Places like Kampala are, for me at least, the places where all of the most enraging injustices </p>
      <p>of the world are presented, bare, raw, and worn to the bone. Seeing people succumb to diseases </p>
      <p>and injuries which in my native Canada would be dealt with quickly as minor inconveniences,</p>
      <p>turns each death and disability into a tragedy all the more powerful because it is </p>
      <p>so obviously preventable and unnecessary. While such tragedies may be the visible vestiges of </p>
      <p>huge economic and political systems bearing their full weight down on the most remote </p>
      <p>and oppressed members of society, to see them first-hand fills one with a sense of personal grief and urgency to act.</p>
      <p>There is also often a sense of guilt. Walking through the hospital, armed with gloves, gowns, and masks,</p>
      <p>chowing down daily on malaria prophylaxis while the doctors and patients struggle to scrape together</p>
      <p>the few dollars it takes to get an needed x-ray, I am acutely aware of my privileged place in those systems which </p>
      <p>keeps the local people under such unjust conditions. </p>
      <p>Part of me wants to not settle for anything more than what the people here, who have taken us into their homes, </p>
      <p>fed us, and taught us, could possibly get themselves. Another part of me knows that like it </p>
      <p>or not, my position in the world is somehow different from that of the others in the hospital.</p>

      <title>Part 2: Home</title>
      <p>
        <italic>I woke from my sleep that Saturday evening in sheets soaked with sweat,</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>as Sarah and I listened to the shrill squeals of bats overhead.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>We were sleeping in a small cabin at Murchison Falls National Park in</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>north-western Uganda, having just completed a successful two days of safari in and about the Nile river. </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>After two weeks spent mostly in the cramped quarters of Mulago hospital, and the smoggy, congested streets of Kampala,</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>taking a leisurely, planned tour of the park to see some wildlife was a welcome diversion.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>All of that came to a sudden end with the flap of a pair of leathery wings in the air around our beds. </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>Having just two nights earlier seen a man in the early throes of rabies, neither Sarah or I were too </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>thrilled at the possibility of meeting that same fate ourselves. We spent a frantic night in the pitch-dark room, </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>terrified that maybe we had been bitten. Bat bites, I had learned, were often invisible and painless, only revealing</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>themselves once it was too late.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>~~~~</p>
      <p>In some ways, the role of the physician in health and disease is simple.  </p>
      <p>The explicit teaching is this: </p>
      <p>Patients arrive with a chief complaint, which sometimes clearly identifies the disease but is sometimes misleading. </p>
      <p>It is the job of the physician to illicit the important symptoms and signs and evaluate their importance in order to </p>
      <p>determine the most likely diagnoses and the patient's likely prognosis. This information should be clearly and empathetically</p>
      <p>communicated to the patient. Then, together, the patient and the doctor have to evaluate the risks and benefits </p>
      <p>of various treatments, and assist the patient in selecting one which will meet their own personal needs and goals.</p>
      <p>The implicit teaching is this:</p>
      <p>As physicians, we are equipped with knowledge and skills which suffering individuals are not</p>
      <p>and by which we may be of assistance. Although the patient's perspective is vital in determining the</p>
      <p>goals of treatment, medical professionals should retain a sense of objectivity in order to more accurately</p>
      <p>determine diagnoses and the relative merits of various treatments. There is an "us" and a "them." The "other" persists.</p>
      <p>
        <italic>"Doctor, heal thyself!"</italic>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, all the above notions of objective risk assessment tend to go out the window whenever we apply them</p>
      <p>to ourselves. 'Medical Student Syndrome,' technically referred to 'hypochondriasis of medical students,' is a particularly</p>
      <p>acute example of this. It is not uncommon for a student during the course of their studies to diagnose themselves</p>
      <p>with, for instance, an aortic dissection, gallstones, peptic ulcer disease, or any one of a number of metabolic</p>
      <p>or endocrine derangements, depending on which disease they happen to be studying at the time.</p>
      <p>When it comes to ourselves, we seem unable to stick to the objectivity and rules we so cooly apply to others.</p>
      <p>So it may be, too, with our ideals of health and justice. </p>
      <p>~~~~</p>
      <p>
        <italic>The ride home the next morning took us on sunny winding road through the Rwenzori mountains and their lush</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>fields of tea and tobacco. Sarah was quiet for the entire ride, likely due in part to the gravol, but certainly also due to </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>her worries about what might happen after the 9-20 day rabies incubation period we had so recently learned about, </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>and the risks of the local Ugandan rabies post-exposure protocols.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>When we arrived back at our hostel in Kampala that night, I called my mother back home in Hamilton</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>and asked for her advice as to what we should do about the possible rabies exposure. She made a few calls </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>to travel doctors in the area and quickly found out that there was another local option, a private clinic called "The Surgery," </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>the longest continually-held practice in Kampala. Started in the 1940s by ex-pat British GPs while Uganda was still under colonial rule, </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>the clinic has been used by international travellers to Kampala for whom nothing less than the 'western standard' would suffice. </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>After speaking to a nurse at the clinic, we soon found that although The Surgery did not use the Semple post-exposure vaccine,</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>the protocol they followed was substantially different from the one we used in Canada, in particular because it did not include</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>the immunoglobin injection during the initial treatment phase.  The nurse told us that despite that, they'd never had any </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>reports of the protocol's failure in all their many years of practice.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>~~~~</p>
      <p>If it is a tragedy each time a Ugandan dies from a preventable, treatable illness, then what is it called</p>
      <p>when a visiting medical student witnesses that tragedy and then promptly visits a clinic which costs </p>
      <p>ten times as much for a much more minor condition? Reasonable precaution? Irony? </p>
      <p>To me it felt like hypocrisy. Most Canadians point to the ideals of Medicare as one of Canada's greatest </p>
      <p>civil achievements: a system of care based on need rather than the ability to pay. As a society, we pool </p>
      <p>risk, share benefits, and sacrifice autonomy for the sake of others in society, usually complete strangers. </p>
      <p>What makes us do so for the sake of strangers within our country but not elsewhere in the world? </p>
      <p>Economics? Geography? Futility?</p>
      <p>~~~~</p>
      <p>
        <italic>"You need that immunoglobin. All of the doctors here at home agree." </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>Despite my protests, consults with the local Mulago doctors, and personal research, I knew that the</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>doctors at home were probably right. If I had been bitten by the bat, and if it had carried rabies, the </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>only rational thing to do would be to minimize the chances that the disease would spread throughout my system. </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>The severe consequences of infection were too great to avoid taking all necessary precautions.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>Unfortunately, even if I managed to procure local immunoglobin, there were still complications. The concentration</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>of IG in human blood is so low that to create the substantial dose necessary for a rabies protocol requires extracts </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>of blood from multiple donors. In Uganda, with rates of HIV infection in urban areas reported to be as high as 30%, </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>receiving such a concentrate of blood products was a risky prospect in itself.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>"Look, health care is practiced differently in Uganda than it is in Canada... and since you can't get the immunoglobin there, </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>your best bet really is to come home. So quit stalling in Kampala and start making arrangements to fly back as soon as possible."</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>I hung up the phone, paused, and started to formulate my plans.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>~~~~</italic>
      </p>
      <p>Many of the doctors we worked alongside at Mulago had actually spent a portion of their</p>
      <p>training in Hamilton. There was a clear sense of camaraderie and shared experience between us</p>
      <p>as we traded back and forth our hilarious fish-out-of-water stories. It was not uncommon for the docs to discuss</p>
      <p>a patient's assessment and plan with finality, and then direct some additional comments towards us: </p>
      <p>"Of course, back in Canada you would likely deal with the problem using... since you'd have the resources for it. </p>
      <p>Here we can't do that so we have to make do."</p>
      <p>Watching the skilled hands and minds of the doctors as they waded through the crowded wards was a unique experience.</p>
      <p>I can't really imagine what it was like for them, having to come up with ad-hoc, 'good-enough' solutions for complicated</p>
      <p>problems after having studied and practiced in Canada where we investigate every symptom to the nth degree with extensive</p>
      <p>follow-up. Were they driven crazy knowing all too well what they were missing? Did they think it unfair that in Canada we </p>
      <p>as students wielded resources even the top doctors in Mulago would envy?</p>
      <p>None of the doctors or nurses or other professionals I met working at the hospital, or even any of the patients,</p>
      <p>indicated that sentiment even once. Rather, there seemed to be an understanding and resignation to our unequal</p>
      <p>relationships: 'Even if we don't have the resources you do at home, come, learn from us and let us learn from you too; </p>
      <p>we understand why you look after yourselves with such caution.'</p>
      <p>The inequalities that separate us may be huge, but they do not have to be barriers to meaningful relationships. </p>
      <p>
        <italic>~~~~</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>A few days later, as my plane smoothly glided off the runway at Entebbe International Airport,</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>my thoughts swarmed with all of the people, places, and events I had witnessed during the past few weeks. </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>After two airplane meals I started to think about how I was going to organize the 28 days </italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>of rabies vaccinations around my remaining clinical electives.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        <italic>By the time I arrived home 23 hours later, I had comfortably slipped back into my daily routines.</italic>
