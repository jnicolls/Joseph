In this article, we focus on the field of telemedicine in developing countries and its role in improving health, using examples from the experience of the IDRC.</hi></item></list><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">One of the authors of this article (LE) was involved in a pioneering project on telemedicine in Uganda in 2000. This aim of this project was to enhance access to health services using telemedicine, such that consultations with doctors who worked in larger hospitals in Mulago and Butabika could be obtained for patients who did not live near a hospital. The project focused on cholera, malaria and HIV/AIDS. Further goals were to disseminate health information and build a continuing medical education program. Finally, the project was meant to document lessons on these different activities.</hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	Nevertheless, the project did offer some valuable lessons for future e-health projects. It was in many respects ahead of its time, and set the stage for more successful e-health projects in Uganda, such as the Uganda Health Information Network and a subsequent telehealth project in Mengo. Indeed, with the support of Memorial University in St. John&#8217;s, NL, the project helped train and mentor numerous staff in telehealth activities; it further helped focus the attention of the government on rural health problems and potential solutions; and it developed educational materials that are in use today.</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	These efforts were quite typical of activities that focused on health and on information and communications technology (ICT) at the time: overly ambitious, lacking in adequate capacity and planning, but spurred by the drive and determination of project proponents, who went on to use their experiences to become champions of telehealth in their countries. What actually happened? As was typical of early telehealth projects in Africa, the project was faced with challenges related to procuring appropriate equipment and setting up infrastructure, as well as difficulties in achieving connectivity. Disappointingly, the project never actually made an online consultation between Kampala and the rural health centres, and it would be remiss to say that it resulted in any direct beneficial health outcomes for the rural population. </hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	The project provided significant insights and learning. First, it helped the organization better understand the challenges of supporting telehealth projects in Africa and helped define some of the key questions it would try to answer. Key among these was a better understanding of how appropriate local capacities, both technical and institutional, should be built, Second was the need to focus on the &#8220;e-readiness&#8221; of the country, particularly with regard to the availability of equipment, cost of access and an enabling regulatory environment. (E-readiness refers to the state of a country&#8217;s ICT infrastructure and the ability of consumers, businesses and governments to use ICT to their benefit.) Finally, this experience prompted greater consideration about the key underlying question: Is telehealth a viable means of solving health problems in developing countries?</hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	In this case, cost&#8211;benefit analyses had not been done and health outcomes had not been measured, in large part because these efforts had been lost in the challenges to implement the pilot project. All these lessons helped shape future thinking about supporting the development of effective health applications. However, it is also of interest to examine some of the lessons from programming in Asia on telehealth to demonstrate how lessons coalesced from one region to the other, despite having been implemented through separate programs.</hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">The objectives of the </hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5" rend="italic">Impact of Remote Telemedicine in Improving Rural Health</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5"> </hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">project in India, part of the Pan Asia Networking (PAN) project, were to study the impact of remote telemedicine in selected villages in India.

Once the service was launched, there was a spike in the number of visitors to the kiosk. After the initial interest, however, the number of visitors dropped precipitously to a few regular, repeat visitors. The drop was explained by the following factors: &#8220;Kiosk Operator&#8217;s ability to administer the kit properly, acceptability by the villagers, identification of the Kiosk in a place where medical care is already dispensed, lack of awareness of the service, distance of the doctor from the village, and availability of competing services such as Registered Indian Medical Practitioners Primary Health Centres, local doctors, etc.&#8221;</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5" rend="superscript">1</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5"> Although the project faced challenges with respect to sustainability, it was, contrary to the Ugandan experience, able to function as a working telemedicine project. However, despite the activity&#8217;s stated objective of understanding telemedicine&#8217;s &#8220;impact,&#8221; no findings were documented with regard to health outcomes.</hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	In Indonesia, t</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">he </hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5" rend="italic">Development of ICT-based Telemedicine System for Primary Community Health Care in Indonesia</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5"> project used existing Internet technology to enhance PC-based medical stations and pilot-tested a telemedicine application. The pilot network consists of six medical stations within community health centres and a station for each referral hospital, health office and test laboratory. The pilot found that human resource capacity-building &#8212; in particular, training to facilitate the adoption of computer and telemedicine technology &#8212; required significantly more time than expected. The project therefore demonstrated the important role that human resource development plays in the sustainable implementation of ICT-based telemedicine systems.

This project studied how ICTs had been used in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and Botswana to address health and development challenges brought about by HIV/AIDS. After having done an extensive literature review, the project proponents undertook a wide-scale electronic survey of individuals and organizations involved in HIV/AIDS issues. Of particular interest was an in-depth impact assessment undertaken in Tanzania and South Africa with 990 respondents.</hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	Moreover, according to the survey, illiteracy was the most important barrier to the use of ICTs in both South Africa and Tanzania. The results echo previous research that showed that illiteracy and localization issues are among the most important factors challenging the more widespread use of ICT solutions.</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">A comparison of respondents from the two countries showed, as expected, that most received information on antiretroviral treatment (ART) from traditional media. However, increased access to information technology in South Africa resulted in 30% of respondents receiving information from cellphones (versus 10% of respondents in Tanzania). Hence the assumption is that, as access to mobile telephony and the Internet rises in Africa, so will the number of people accessing health information through these technologies.</hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	According to the survey on the effectiveness of ICTs, it was perceived that radio, print and television, as well as face-to-face meetings, were &#8220;extremely effective&#8221; media. The majority of respondents &#8220;didn&#8217;t know&#8221; whether computers, email and the Internet could be effective. Strangely, almost 9% saw the Internet as &#8220;harmful&#8221; (the highest percentage in that category). Although one can question the methodology of a perception questionnaire as well as the terms used &#8212;What do &#8220;harmful&#8221; or &#8220;extremely effective&#8221; actually mean? &#8212; one cannot deny that conventional communication methods are still perceived as the most widely used modes of information transmission. </hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">According to the Pan Asia Networking Prospectus, health is the area where ICTs are likely to have the most direct positive impact in improving the well-being <lb/>of Asian communities </hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">(</hi><ref target="http://www.idrc.ca/uploads/user-S/11700792731prospectus_final.pdf"><hi rend="Internet_Link">www.idrc.ca/uploads/user-S/11700792731prospectus_final.pdf</hi></ref><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">)</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">. However, the prospectus also affirms that the first generation of largely donor-driven &#8220;telemedicine&#8221; projects has generally had only a marginal impact on people&#8217;s health. Indeed, many of the technologies previously developed and tested were too expensive to be widely adopted in resource-poor set</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">tings. Much like Acacia, PAN sees the advent of more </hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	The authors of the AfriAfya (African Network for Health Knowledge Management and Communication) study conclude that the best practices for using ICTs in the fight against HIV/AIDS were (1) use of mobile phones and SMS; (2) ICTs for up-to-date HIV management information; (3) ICTs for mobilization; (4) combination of different ICTs; and (5) telephone counselling. They also pointed out that the use of &#8220;modern&#8221; ICTs is still very limited, but that there is huge potential; that because institutions and health workers remain reliant on &#8220;conventional&#8221; ICTs there is a need to integrate both &#8220;modern&#8221; and &#8220;conventional&#8221; to get the best results; and, perhaps most important, that changing perceptions and behaviours requires careful planning and patience.</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">Similarly, Acacia&#8217;s 2006&#8211;2011 prospectus (</hi><ref target=""><hi rend="Internet_Link">www.idrc<lb/>.ca/en/ev-113431-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html</hi></ref><hi meTypesetSize="10">)</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5"> finds that the impact of ICTs has been constrained by the fact that access to them at the front lines of health care in rural areas has been generally non-existent. However, the rapid expansion of mobile telephony into urban and rural areas in Africa is seen as having brought about new opportunities for access and innovation in the use of ICTs to facilitate the delivery of health care.&#160;</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	Although most mobile infrastructure in Africa is too slow and expensive for connecting computers to the Internet, low bandwidth communication applications </hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">have emerged that use mobile phones or personal digital assistants (PDAs) such as Palm Pilots to connect via mobile networks. Indeed, &#8220;while information designed and formatted for the World Wide Web is generally too bandwidth intensive to be transmitted over mobile networks, the information itself, properly formatted for small devices, takes up very little bandwidth.&#8221; PDAs and smart phones are also seen as more advantageous because of their robustness (no moving parts), their relative affordability, and their ability to be maintained &#8220;in areas with little or no electricity infrastructure through the use of solar power rechargers&#8221; (</hi><ref target="http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-113431-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html"><hi rend="Internet_Link">www.idrc.ca/en/ev-113431-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html</hi></ref><hi meTypesetSize="10.5"> ).</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">Of particular interest, therefore, is the fact that the Acacia program, given that mobile telephony and PDAs are increasingly pervasive in Africa and have the potential to play an important role there, has focused much of its current project support on that theme (</hi><ref target="http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/at_glance/af_ictindicators_2006.html"><hi rend="Internet_Link">www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/at_glance/af_ictindicators_2006.html</hi></ref><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">). </hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">Examples of mobile-enabled health applications supported by Acacia are listed in Textbox 2.</hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="9" rend="bold color(870000)">Textbox 2: Potential health applications of cellphones</hi><hi meTypesetSize="9" rend="bold superscript color(870000)">2</hi><hi meTypesetSize="9">automation of demographic surveillance activities such as those at the core of pioneering health care initiatives, e.g., the Tanzanian Essential Health Interventions <lb/>Project</hi><hi meTypesetSize="9">testing of the use of SMS (short message service) <lb/>reminders in the treatment of tuberculosis in Cape Town, South Africa</hi><hi meTypesetSize="9">delivery of continuing medical education and <lb/>professional development via PDA</hi><hi meTypesetSize="9">delivery of time-sensitive alerts to patients and health care workers</hi><hi meTypesetSize="9">maintenance of patient records for HIV-positive <lb/>patients&#8217; lifelong drug treatments</hi><hi meTypesetSize="9">management of specific health care initiatives such as the roll-out of antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis treatment initiatives</hi></p><p rend="Text Body"><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">	PAN&#8217;s strategic document also emphasizes that more research is needed to gauge which applications and projects in the area of health have made a difference, to understand why they have or have not been successful and, when warranted, to scale them up. However, the fast pace of innovation in both ICTs and health research means that there is also a need to develop, implement and evaluate new applications, particularly in the area of demographic surveillance of disease incidence and medical compliance, using new technologies such as mobile phones. According to the prospectus, another area that has recently come to the forefront in Asia is the issue of pandemics. First severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and now the potential for an Avian flu pandemic are perceived as serious threats to the health of Asian populations as well as the rest of the world. A key to mitigating the spread of these infectious diseases is to ensure that data on outbreaks are captured and communicated to the relevant experts in real time. ICTs can play a critical role in helping to prevent or control pandemics, although more research and experimentation need to be done to identify the most appropriate and cost-effective </hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">means of developing health communications processes in rural and remote areas, where many of these</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5"> outbreaks start.</hi><hi meTypesetSize="10.5">pervasive technologies, such as mobile phones and PDAs, as a new generation of health applications that have actually made a demonstrable difference.

As with Acacia and PAN, the LAC prospectus affirms that digital technologies and ICT-based solutions provide a powerful tool to change the ways in which health services are managed and delivered to the population at large, and to low-income and marginalized communities in particular. ICTs and the Internet, for example, can bring to these communities (at low cost) contacts with larger health centres located in urban areas, opening access to health prevention measures, consultations, updated valuable medical information, coordination in the treatment of patients, adequate and timely distribution of medicines, collection and effective distribution of valuable data on profiles and patterns of threatening epidemics, contagious diseases and other ailments, among others.

This, of course, is particularly significant in the context of developing countries with limited financial resources and telecommunications infrastructure.
