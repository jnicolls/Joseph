Previous systematic reviews have not explored whether it is preferable to add insulin therapy or to add an additional oral agent in patients with secondary failure. Goudswaard et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> focused on switching a patient&#x02019;s therapeutic regimen to insulin monotherapy versus adding insulin to oral antidiabetic agents.

Our search strategy was developed in consultation with a research librarian well versed in the conduct of systematic reviews and in the use of MeSH (MEDLINE subject headings) and key terms.</p><p>The MEDLINE-based search strategy formed the foundation for searching in other databases. We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases from their inception until June 2007: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Conrolled Trials, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Academic OneFile, PASCAL, Global Health Database, LILACS, HealthSTAR, and PubMed. Other literature sources were also searched, including: reference lists of all included studies and relevant narrative reviews; clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, CenterWatch Clinical Trials Listing Service, and Current Controlled Trials); OCLC Proceedings First and OCLC Papers First databases to identify studies presented at conferences and proceedings; and Proquest and Index to Theses to identify relevant theses and dissertations. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies producing insulin glargine (Sanofi-Aventis), insulin detemir (Novo Nordisk) and NPH (Novo Nordisk, Lilly) to inquire about other published or unpublished studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of studies</title><p>Citations identified in the literature search were independently screened by two reviewers (JG, SS) to select potentially relevant articles. The full articles from this list were retrieved and subsequently reviewed by 2 reviewers (JG, LB) for inclusion in the systematic review. Inter-rater agreement at this stage was assessed using Cohen&#x02019;s kappa statistic. Disagreements between reviewers were reconciled by consensus; a third-party intermediary was not required. Reviewers were not blinded to the authors, journal, or publisher of the studies. Non-English abstracts and articles were assessed by one reviewer (SK).</p><p>Studies were included if they had the following characteristics: RCTs, whether parallel or crossover design; participants inadequately controlled on their current oral antidiabetic regimen, defined as an Hb<sub>A1C</sub> &#x0003e; 7% or a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &#x0003e; 7 mmol/L; participants insulin na&#x000ef;ve at baseline; subjects randomly assigned to receive the addition of either basal insulin therapy (insulin glargine, detemir, or NPH) or another oral antidiabetic agent from any class (biguanide, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, non-sulfonylurea secretagogue, or glucosidase inhibitor). We use the term &#x0201c;basal&#x0201d; to mean administration of an intermediate or long-acting insulin as 100% of daily insulin dose; specifically, these would be regimens using NPH, glargine, or detemir.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> We felt that crossover trials were suitable for our clinical question, as diabetes management is a chronic condition of which we do not expect a carry-over effect of treatment in respect to blood glucose levels. Data from crossover trials were entered as a parallel study.</p><p>In addition to the above criteria, studies must have reported (or given the information to calculate) change in Hb<sub>A1C</sub> (%) from baseline. Glycemic control was our primary outcome, measured by change in Hb<sub>A1C</sub> and the proportion of individuals achieving an Hb<sub>A1C</sub> &#x02264; 7%. Secondary outcomes included change in FPG (mmol/L), change in weight (kg) and the proportion of participants who experienced &#x02265; 1 hypoglycemic event as defined by the study investigators.</p></sec><sec><title>Data extraction and management</title><p>Two reviewers (JG, LB) independently extracted the data from all articles that met predefined eligibility criteria.

Minor revisions to the extraction form were made after this trial period to provide the content found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="textbox1">Textbox 1</xref>. We attempted to contact authors to verify, interpret and obtain missing data. In addition to extracting data, the reviewers assessed the overall methodological quality of studies using the Jadad scale.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> Methodological quality was assessed on the basis of information reported in the published article only. In addition, the scale devised by Schulz and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> was used to assess allocation of concealment. Funding sources for included studies were also considered.</p><p>If the mean change and its respective standard deviation were missing, we calculated the mean change from baseline by subtracting the mean baseline Hb<sub>A1C</sub> from the mean Hb<sub>A1C</sub> at the last follow-up date.

We chose RR as a measure of effect, given considerations of consistency and interpretability. Publication bias was assessed by examining the symmetry of a funnel plot, where sample size is plotted against the treatment effect.

When all studies were pooled, the addition of basal insulin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in Hb<sub>A1C</sub> in comparison with the use of an oral agent as add-on therapy, but this difference was not clinically significant (WMD 0.17; 95% CI -0.33 to -0.02)(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="appendix1_fig">Appendix 1</xref> for Forest plots of meta-analyses).

A third measure of glycemic control was change in FPG from baseline, where an improvement in the insulin arm versus the oral agent arm was found (WMD -1.29; 95% CI -1.61 to -0.98).

Although insulin showed a statistically significant benefit, the difference was small and of limited clinical importance. The clinical impact of a 0.17% reduction in Hb<sub>A1C</sub> associated with insulin therapy versus the addition of oral therapy must be viewed in light of the absence of large-scale quality trials. The 95% CI showed potential benefit ranging from a 0.02% to a 0.33% reduction in Hb<sub>A1C</sub>. We reported pooled estimates of the WMD in change in Hb<sub>A1C</sub> from baseline, comparing insulin and oral agent treatment according to the type of insulin agent used. Although the overall pooled estimate favoured the addition of basal insulin, analysis stratified by insulin type to obtain an indirect comparison<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref> showed no apparent difference between NPH or glargine in comparison with the addition of an oral antidiabetic agent.

A much larger magnitude of effect was observed with respect to change in FPG, but this might be expected insofar as insulin dosing was titrated on the basis of FPG levels in all of the studies. In view of the significant heterogeneity between NPH and glargine groups, the magnitude of effect must be considered in context. Insulin glargine was generally used as a third-line agent, whereas NPH was added as a second-line agent. Therefore, the magnitude of effect may have been influenced by other factors, such as differences in postprandial blood glucose control, which could account for the diminished effect observed in the change in Hb<sub>A1C</sub>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></p><p>The relative safety of the 2 treatment strategies was evaluated using 2 secondary outcomes: proportion of subjects experiencing &#x02265; 1 hypoglycemic event, and change in weight. As expected, hypoglycemic events were more frequent in the insulin group than in the oral agent group. This appears to have been driven mostly by the large number of studies that used metformin as the comparison agent. The magnitude of effect is diminished and is statistically non-significant when only studies using a thiazolidinedione are considered. Overall, there was no difference in weight gain when insulin versus an oral agent was used as add-on therapy. The significant heterogeneity observed (I<sup>2</sup> 92.8%; p &#x0003c; 0.001) is explained in part by subgroup analysis. Of the 7 studies that used NPH and reported weight as an outcome measure, 4 used metformin as the comparison oral agent and showed a non-significant increase in weight gain among the the NPH users (WMD 1.29; 95% CI 0.62&#x02013;1.96). This is consistent with metformin use in general, which is advocated for overweight patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> In the insulin glargine subgroup, insulin users experienced significantly less weight gain than those who used rosiglitazone as an add-on agent (WMD -1.30; 95% CI -1.41 to -1.19).</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, the overall quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis was poor, as indicated by their average Jadad score. We identified several recurring problems of methodology. For example, although all studies used random allocation, the process of randomization and concealment was not adequately described. Moreover, the lack of blinding was an important limitation across all studies. Proper blinding would require a double-dummy design whereby participants would administer an injection and an oral tablet concurrently. Second, follow-up times were relatively short, considering that people with type 2 diabetes receive treatment for the rest of their lives. Two studies had a follow-up of 1 year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> However, the 2 treatment groups might not show comparable efficacy after 2, 5, or 10 years. Longer follow-up times would increase the external validity of the results. A third limitation is that our primary outcomes are surrogate markers and lack information on long-term outcomes, such as microvascular or cardiovascular events. A fourth consideration concerns the limit to which a triple oral therapy can lower Hb<sub>A1C</sub>. The addition of a third oral agent is unlikely to decrease Hb<sub>A1C</sub> levels by greater than 1.5% to 2.0%; therefore, insulin may be a more appropriate option for those whose diabetes is very poorly controlled (&#x0003e; 9.5%) with secondary oral antidiabetic therapy. Evidence for this exists in the findings of Rosenstock and colleagues,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> which show that the glucose-lowering benefit of insulin glargine, as measured by FPG, was greater when baseline Hb<sub>A1C</sub> was &#x02265; 9.5%. A fifth limitation is the absence of data for secondary outcomes. Hypoglycemic event reporting was inconsistent, and definitions of hypoglycemia were rare (n = 3).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> Similarly, reporting on weight change was inconsistent between studies. Consistent reporting of other side-effects such as edema or pain at the injection site would aid in the applicability of the results.</p><p>Although every effort was made to minimize biases in the review process, potential biases still exist. These biases were limited the involvement of 2 independent reviewers involved at each major stage in the review process. Publication bias was suggested by asymmetry observed on the funnel plot, although other sources of bias, including selection bias, true heterogeneity, data irregularities, artefact, or chance may explain this asymmetry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></p><p>The results of this systematic review are relevant for clinicians working with patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes who are using either a sulfonylurea as monotherapy or in combination with metformin. The choice of treatment regimens for add-on therapy should be evaluated in light of current Hb<sub>A1C</sub> levels and the risk of hypoglycemia. Non-therapeutic reasons such as cost and patient preference or adverse effects should be given adequate weight in view of the small magnitude of benefit observed for insulin use as add-on therapy. The optimal strategy for adding basal insulin therapy to an oral antidiabetic regimen remains to be demonstrated. More rigorous studies are required to establish the ideal treatment strategy for people with type 2 diabetes experiencing secondary failure on oral antidiabetic therapy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Tamara Durec for assistance designing and implementing the search strategy; Stefan Kuhle for evaluating all non-English articles; Donna Dryden for providing comments on an early draft; and Drs Raymond Reynolds, Curtis Triplitt, and Gary Ko for providing additional data from their respective studies.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Competing interests: None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding source: The Alliance for Canadian Health Outcomes Research in Diabetes (ACHORD) New Emerging Team (NET) grant is sponsored by the Canadian Diabetes Association, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, the Kidney Foundation of Canada and CIHR (Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes and the Institute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health).
