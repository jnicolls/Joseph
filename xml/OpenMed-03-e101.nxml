The relation between prognosis discussion and patient and family satisfaction with EOL care is unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Using a 5-domain questionnaire, we surveyed inpatients with cancer or end-stage medical disease and their families on their satisfaction with specific aspects of EOL care and their overall satisfaction with EOL care. Scores were standardized to 0&#x02013;100 points. We compared the results based on whether or not a physician had discussed the patient&#x02019;s prognosis with them, as well as on whether the patient and family member agreed on whether the patient was nearing the end of life. Supplementary questions were also asked (e.g., preferred location of death, willingness to discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 569 eligible patients and 176 eligible family members, 440 (77%) patients and 160 (91%) family members participated in the study. Overall, 18% of patients and 30.1% of families recalled a prognosis discussion with a physician. Patients who recalled such a discussion were more satisfied with overall care (76.1 v. 73.1 points, difference 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 5.67, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02) and with communication and decision-making aspects of care (77.9 v. 72.4 points, difference 5.5, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.52, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.008), and were more willing to discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation status (69.6% v. 55.3%, difference 14.3, 95% CI 2.15 to 26.45, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03), than those who did not. Patients who were in accord with their family member as to whether they were nearing the end of life also showed significant satisfaction in these 3 areas. Family members&#x02019; overall satisfaction was also higher among those who recalled a prognosis discussion (75.3 v. 70.4 points, difference 4.9, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Multivariate analyses confirmed the significance of the relation between the prognosis discussion and overall satisfaction with care for both patients and family members.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although discussions about prognosis occur infrequently for patients who have advanced terminal disease, such discussions with patients and their families may facilitate advance care planning and improve satisfaction with EOL care.

We sought to enrich our understanding of the relation between satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care and discussions regarding the patient&#x02019;s prognosis. We hypothesized that prognostic discussions would have no adverse effect and may improve patient and family satisfaction with EOL care. Furthermore, in a secondary analysis, we postulated that when there is agreement between patient and family member on whether or not the patient is near or at the end of life, both groups would be more satisfied with EOL care than when they have discordant views.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>We administered a cross-sectional survey to inpatients in 5 Canadian tertiary care teaching hospitals.

Although mental status was not formally assessed, we excluded patients who were likely to have communication difficulties, such as language or cognitive barriers, on the basis of conversation with staff or with the patient in some circumstances. Patients identified a family member or person close to them (hereafter referred to as the family member) who provided some form of care at home. If no such person was available, patients were given only the patient-based questionnaire. All study participants gave informed written consent before participation; this study was approved by the research ethics boards of all participating institutions.</p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaire development</title><p>The overall goal of this research program was to develop and validate a novel satisfaction questionnaire to measure quality EOL care. There are no existing instruments for use in our target population in the hospital setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> The development of the questionnaire and its pre-testing have been explained in detail elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Briefly, to generate items for this satisfaction questionnaire, we reviewed taxonomies of quality EOL care published at the time of protocol development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> and held focus groups with health care professionals. We then conducted 12 semistructured interviews with seriously ill inpatients who met the inclusion criteria to determine whether any elements had been overlooked or were ambiguously phrased. The final 26 items were categorized into 5 domains: medical and nursing care, communication and decision-making, social relationships and support, meaningful existence, and community care.</p><p>Participants in this current study rated their satisfaction with each item on a 5-point Likert scale. Since the items were largely derived from the existing published literature and complemented with feedback from patients and health care providers, the questionnaire had both face and content validity. The questionnaire can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thecarenet.ca/">www.thecarenet.ca</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Variables</title><p>Scores for the items in the questionnaire were summed for each of the EOL care domains and for overall satisfaction and then standardized to a maximum score of 100 points by dividing by the maximum possible score and multiplying by 100. Patients and family members were also asked if they had had a discussion regarding their prognosis with a physician, using the question, &#x0201c;Have the doctors told you how long you (or the patient) can expect to live?&#x0201d; Response categories for both groups were yes/no. If the response was &#x0201c;no,&#x0201d; participants were then asked if they would like to be told this information. Next, to assess self-evaluation of the patient&#x02019;s prognosis, all participants were asked if the patient was currently facing issues at the end of life (response options: I/the patient am/is currently facing them or have faced them; will likely face them in the next few weeks to months; will likely face them in the next 6 months; will likely face them in the next year; or not relevant).</p><p>Patients who were aware of their prognosis may have a different preference for other EOL decisions or aspects of care. Accordingly, patients were asked if they were willing to discuss their cardiopulmonary resuscitation preferences and to identify what level of care they would prefer to receive currently, using a scale of 1&#x000ad;&#x02013;10 where 1 = comfort measures only and 10 = full aggressive curative care. Finally, both patients and family members were asked to state their preference for location of death (response options: home, hospital, or doesn&#x02019;t matter).</p><p>Sociodemographic data collected for the patients included availability of a family member, education, employment status, age, sex, marital status, religion, and type of community in which they lived (rural v. urban). Patient health-related variables included diagnosis and self-assessed functional status, determined using the Katz Functional Status Tool,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> a 6-item scale that measures functional ability with 0 = dependence and 1 = independence for each item; scores were summed across the items to determine the overall score. Family member sociodemographic data included education, employment status, age, sex, and relationship to patient. The family member was also asked to assess the patient&#x02019;s functional ability using the Katz Functional Status Tool, and was asked whether the patient was currently facing issues at the end of life; the 5 response options were the same as those offered to the patient.</p><p>Results for the primary analysis were categorized according to whether the study participants had discussed prognosis with the physician. In the secondary analysis, we categorized results according to whether the patient and family member had selected the same response when asked whether the patient is currently facing EOL issues. Satisfaction with EOL care was compared based on these categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The number of patients who had a discussion about prognosis was calculated and reported. Bivariate relationships between those who did and those who did not have a prognostic discussion with the physician, from both patient and family member perspectives, were examined using <italic>t</italic> tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests: <italic>t</italic> tests were used for continuous variables (e.g., age, overall satisfaction) and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests were used for categorical variables (e.g., gender, marital status). No adjustments were made for multiple tests of significance. Ordinary least squares regression models were developed to identify significant factors that were associated with satisfaction with EOL care. The dependent variables included overall satisfaction with EOL care and the satisfaction scores for each domain. For all models, the independent variables were the sociodemographic and health-related covariates for patients and family members listed above. All independent covariates were entered as a block into the regression models. Before performing the multivariate analyses, we corrected for skewness the assessment of functional impairment by both patients and family members by squaring this term. An <italic>F</italic> test was used to test overall fit of the model. Finally, we repeated the bivariate analyses described above to determine the associations with patient and family member agreement and disagreement on the patient&#x02019;s EOL status.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 569 eligible patients were identified and approached for consent at 5 Canadian hospitals between November 2001 and June 2003.

Patients with cancer were much more likely to have a discussion about prognosis that patients with medical diseases (40/151 [26%] v. 34/261 [13%], difference 13.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.33% to 21.60%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0006).</p><p>Overall satisfaction with EOL care was higher among patients who had discussed prognosis with a physician than among those who had not (76.1 v. 73.1 points, difference 3.0, 95% CI 0.40 to 5.67, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02).

However, if knowledge of prognosis is not desired or the discussion is done poorly, the quality of EOL care may be diminished. </p><p>In this study, we surveyed 440 patients and 160 family members to examine the relation between having a conversation with the physician about prognosis and satisfaction with EOL care. We formed our study population based on established clinical criteria that define groups of patients who have a 50% probability of 6-month survival. Although more than 50% of patients died within 6 months of the interview, a minority of patients (18%) and families (30%) recalled having such a conversation with physicians. Those patients who stated they had had such a discussion were more likely to discuss their preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, agree that EOL issues were relevant to them, and desire a home death. Other study results have shown that these conversations occur infrequently, that the physician and patient don&#x02019;t always agree on whether such a discussion took place, that the patient and family tend to have overly optimistic expectations, and that patients and families who have unrealistic expectations of the prognosis are more likely to choose aggressive terminal care in hospital.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></p><p>Perhaps our most significant observation was that patients and family members who had discussed prognosis with their physicians were equally or more satisfied with EOL care than those who had not. Furthermore, when patients and families agreed on prognosis, they reported greater satisfaction with care than those who disagreed. We are not aware of other reports in the literature comparing patient satisfaction with prognostic disclosure, but our findings are consistent with those of numerous other studies of optimal EOL care that suggest that improving communication and decision-making will have the greatest impact on quality of care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> It may be that discussions about prognosis are an integral part of quality EOL care.</p><p>Another important finding from this study was that patients who have end-stage medical diagnoses are less likely than patients who have cancer to have a discussion about prognosis. Given differing and sometimes unpredictable disease trajectories in patients who have advanced, end-stage medical diseases, this is not surprising.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> However, symptom burden and short-term outcomes for elderly patients who have end-stage medical disease is often as poor as or worse than that for patients who have cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></p><p>Waiting until a terminal prognosis is certain before initiating a discussion about prognosis may limit opportunities for adequate information exchange and time to prepare for death. Patients and families accept prognostic uncertainty,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> and honest, timely, and complete communication are key determinants of overall satisfaction with care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> Despite a high risk of mortality in ensuing months, most patients reported that they had not had an EOL discussion. Over half of those patients stated that they would rather not discuss prognosis with their physicians. This result is consistent with a similar survey of patients with advanced medical disease, in which 40% reported that they would prefer not to discuss life expectancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> Interestingly, those who preferred not to discuss these issues tended to have a much more optimistic outlook on their prognosis. They may not see the relevance of having such discussion if they do not see themselves near or at the end of life. There may be other undescribed or unrecognized barriers to these discussions; this issue warrants further investigation. </p><p>In contrast, although most family members had not had a prognosis discussion, 90% of them indicated that they would like to have such a discussion, a finding that is congruent with other reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> Our finding of the association between patient and family member congruency on whether the patient was &#x0201c;facing EOL&#x0201d; and higher overall satisfaction with care suggests that efforts to align preferences for prognosis disclosure between patients and family may increase satisfaction with EOL care. Since neither the patient nor the family may understand the importance of accurate prognostic information in quality EOL care and neither may initiate the discussion, it is incumbent on health care professionals to take this lead and to foster the climate in which such discussions can be held. Guidelines for these discussions have been published and provide a good resource for assisting physicians in this challenging task.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></p><p>This study has several limitations. First, we relied on patient and family member recall that a prognosis discussion had or had not occurred. We did not explore whether a prognosis discussion was attempted and discontinued because of patient preference to avoid such a discussion. It is possible that physicians did have such a discussion about prognosis but that it was not recognized or remembered as such. What is important is not whether the communication actually transpired but whether the patient (or family member) recalls, from their subjective perspective, the key prognostic information necessary to adequately prepare for life&#x02019;s end. Furthermore, we asked only whether patients had a discussion regarding how long they had to live. There may have been other prognostic discussions by patients and their doctors that focused on quality of life or functional status. Thus, our findings are applicable only to one aspect of prognostic discussion, quantity of life. Second, this study was conducted in academic tertiary care Canadian hospitals with principally white, Anglo-Saxon, Christian subjects; therefore, our findings may not be applicable to other settings. Third, given the cross-sectional nature of our survey, we cannot attribute increased satisfaction to a prior prognosis discussion. Fourth, we conducted multiple tests of significance, and thus some of our significant observations may be due to chance. Finally, to measure satisfaction we used a novel instrument; the clinical importance of a difference of 4&#x02013;5 points on this instrument is unknown. </p><p>In summary, the results of this study suggest that when prognosis is discussed with patients and families, satisfaction with care may be greater, especially in relation to communication and decision-making. We have previously established that having time to adequately prepare for life&#x02019;s end is very important to most seriously ill Canadians and their families.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Therefore, communicating prognosis with seriously ill patients and their families, and ensuring shared perceptions of EOL status, may have a positive impact on EOL care. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Competing interests: None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding source: Provided by the National Health and Research Development Program of Canada for Dr. Daren Heyland.
