The analgesic effect produced by the penetrating needle was relatively weak and less persistent compared with previous studies that were performed without effective double-blind controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> Furthermore, we found no significant correlation between the analgesic effect and <italic>de qi</italic>, which has been considered essential for acupuncture analgesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the analgesia produced by skin pressure with the non-penetrating needles, which may stimulate high-threshold skin mechanoreceptors,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> may mimic the analgesic effect experienced in acupressure treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> Further research using appropriate controls is required for addressing this issue.</p><p>Second, in practice, additional manipulations or adjustments to the insertion depth and direction of the needle are performed after penetration to achieve <italic>de qi</italic> with each needle application.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> In our study, the needles were designed to provide uniform direction and depth of needle insertion in all subjects. In addition, we did not conduct additional manipulation after needle insertion. Therefore, all of the subjects received the same stimulus to allow comparison of the effects of needle application. We believe a change in stimulus would likely have changed our outcomes of interest. However, the pain intensity among subjects who perceived <italic>de qi</italic> with penetrating and non-penetrating needles was not less than the pain intensity among those who did not perceive <italic>de qi</italic>. As such, it is possible that <italic>de qi</italic> is not a precondition of subsequent acupuncture analgesia.</p><p>Third, we selected a crossover design because of resource constraints. As reported previously, crossover designs have often shown greater statistical power than parallel-group designs with large samples.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> In our case, although our sample was relatively small, it was sufficient to apply the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test to reveal a significant difference in analgesic effect between the penetrating and non-penetrating needles. Although the small sample was a potential limitation, the differences obtained between the two types of needles would be sufficiently small to be considered clinically significant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></p><p>Fourth, there may have been a carry-over analgesic effect of the treatment. To prevent a carry-over effect, we designed the study so that there would be an interval of at least 24 hours between the two needle trials. This interval was determined based on findings from previous studies, where alleviation of experimental pain with acupuncture at the LI-4 point was maintained for about 1&#x000a0;hour after needle removal with manual acupuncture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> and for up to 16 hours after needle removal with electrical acupuncture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> In our study, significant alleviation of pain was observed only until 20 minutes after needle removal. We observed no significant difference in pain intensity between the group who received the penetrating needle first and the group who received the non-penetrating needle first; therefore, we believe the results were not biased by the carry-over or order effect.</p><p>We believe that our method of blinding practitioners using validated double-blind needles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> was successful and that the subjects were unaware of the use of non-penetrating blunt-tipped needles as in previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> However, the successful blinding of subjects should be interpreted with caution: the subjects were not specifically asked whether they believed they had received a penetrating or a non-penetrating needle.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our results support the use of double-blind methodology in future acupuncture research. Large randomized controlled double-blind trials involving different types of pain (e.g., secondary pain after excessive tonic muscle tension) in which patients are informed of the possible use of non-penetrating needles are necessary. Also, further studies are required to determine the relation between analgesia and <italic>de qi</italic> elicited after needle insertion.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Trial registration number: ISRCTN50179298</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Educational Foundation of Hanada Gakuenfor financial support and Professor Ikuo Homma (Second Department of Physiology, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo) for help in attaining approval by the Ethics Committee of Showa University.
