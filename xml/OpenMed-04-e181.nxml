To address this topic, Bangalore and colleagues performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 33 randomized controlled trials that evaluated a total of 12 306 patients and found that beta-blockers (either given to beta-blocker-naive patients, or continued versus discontinued in trials that included patients with pre-existing beta-blocker therapy) were not associated with any significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or heart failure. However, they were associated with a 35% reduction (odds ratio [OR] 0.65) of nonfatal myocardial infarction at the expense of a 101% increase (OR 2.16) in nonfatal stroke.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> In a comparison of patients treated with beta-blockers and controls, there was an absolute reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction of 1.7% (number needed to treat [NNT] 63) but an absolute increase in the risk of nonfatal stroke of 0.4% (number needed to harm [NNH] 275). Relative to controls, beta-blockers were also associated with a greater risk of perioperative bradycardia (NNH 22) and perioperative hypotension requiring treatment (NNH 17). Among the trials included in the analysis, the Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation Study (POISE) trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> carried the greatest weight. There were no sponsors for this meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Implication and perspectives</title><p>This study confirmed what some already suspected on the basis of the POISE trial:<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> that perioperative beta-blockade is associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction at the cost of an increased risk of stroke. More importantly, this study quantified the treatment effects in absolute terms. At the population level, for every stroke incurred, more than 4 myocardial infarction events may be averted with beta-blocker therapy. The American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association have now updated their guidelines for perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> to reflect the newer data presented in this study. Absolute risk reductions (and NNTs) are, however, linked to baseline risks for specific types of events. As a result, there may not be a single overriding treatment recommendation that applies to all patients. The findings of this study may allow clinicians to more meaningfully discuss the benefits and risks of beta-blocker therapy with patients while negotiating a mutually agreeable treatment plan. There are specific patient profiles (e.g., documented coronary artery disease with a high risk of ischemic cardiac events) for which the potential benefits of beta-blockers may nonetheless be justified, even in light of this newly recognized risk of stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Resolution of the clinical vignette</title><p>For most patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, current evidence does not support starting beta-blocker therapy as a strategy to lower perioperative cardiovascular risk. However, in individuals at high risk for ischemic heart disease, the benefit of beta-blockers may outweigh the risk of stroke and possible death. The patient in this vignette is estimated to have only an intermediate risk of perioperative myocardial infarction, given the planned orthopedic surgery and his history of diabetes mellitus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> In this context, the anticipated benefit compared to risk is probably not high enough to warrant beta-blocker therapy. However, beta-blocker therapy might be appropriate for a patient with higher risk of ischemic cardiac events. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Revascularization for renal artery stenosis</title><sec><title>Clinical vignette</title><p>A 62-year-old woman is referred for evaluation of severe hypertension.

These findings indicate that the potentially harmful and costlyinvestigations used to diagnose renal artery stenosis (e.g., computed tomography with intravenous administration of contrast agent, catheter angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging with administration of gadolinium) will not lead to an advisable treatment strategy. As such, internists should consider avoiding such investigations entirely. </p></sec><sec><title>Resolution of the clinical vignette</title><p>This patient likely has atherosclerotic stenosis of the renal artery, complicated by hypertension.

However, warfarin therapy is cumbersome because of its narrow therapeutic window and the associated hemorrhagic risk. As a result, frequent laboratory monitoring is required, and the patient must be cautious about potential interactions with other drugs and food. This study introduces a new treatment paradigm, with dabigatran as an alternative to warfarin for anticoagulation, and presents impressive efficacy and safety evidence favouring the new drug. The use of this oral direct thrombin inhibitor may simplify previously complex dosing regimens, and it may mitigate the need for routine monitoring. However, several issues need to be resolved before this drug can be adopted into widespread clinical practice: the balance between relative benefits and harms of the 2 doses must be determined; provincial and national approvals must be obtained; pricing must be determined to ensure affordability for the patient; and cost-effectiveness must be assessed (i.e., net costs to the system).</p></sec><sec><title>Resolution of the clinical vignette</title><p>The physician discusses with the patient the possibility of using dabigatran, rather than warfarin, for systemic anticoagulation.

The primary outcomes of interest were serious vascular events (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death), major coronary events, stroke, all-cause mortality and major extracranial bleeding. Meta-analysis of the primary prevention trials revealed that ASA was associated with a lower rate of serious vascular events than no ASA (absolute event rate 0.51% v. 0.57% per year; NNT 1667). The rate of major bleeding was greater with ASA (absolute event rate 0.10% v. 0.07% per year; NNH 3333).

The adage that &#x0201c;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&#x0201d; holds true here, and in this instance, we (AAL and WAG) are the &#x0201c;beholders.&#x0201d; The selection of these particular notable papers arises from our own personal strategies for surveillance of the literature, which are based on the principles we have outlined here. High-quality health care implies practice that is consistent with best evidence, and all providers should develop their own strategies for incorporating evidence into practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This invited review is based on a plenary presentation entitled &#x0201c;Top 5 Papers in General Internal Medicine 2008/2009&#x0201d; given by Dr. W.
