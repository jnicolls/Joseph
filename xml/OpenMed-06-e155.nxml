Previous studies in Alberta have shown that provision of care through Primary Care Networks (PCNs) is associated with better quality of care and better outcomes for people with diabetes, possibly because of greater utilization of chronic disease management programs. However, it is unknown whether First Nations individuals and those in lower SES groups experience these benefits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used administrative and laboratory data for a population-based cohort analysis of Alberta residents under 65 years of age with diabetes. The primary outcome, assessed over a 1-year period, was admission to hospital or emergency department visit for a diabetes-specific ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC). Secondary outcomes were 2 quality-of-care indicators (likelihood of measurement of glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] and or retinal screening) and 2 measures of health care utilization (visits to specialist and primary care physicians). We used negative binomial regression to determine the association between care within a PCN and hospital admission or emergency department visit for diabetes-specific ACSCs. We also assessed outcomes in 3 populations of interest (individuals receiving a health care subsidy [household income less than $39&#x000a0;250 and not eligible for Income Support], those receiving Income Support, and First Nations individuals) relative to the remainder of the population, controlling for whether care was provided in a PCN and adjusting for several baseline characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified a total of 106&#x000a0;653 patients with diabetes eligible for our study, of whom 43&#x000a0;327 (41%) received care in a PCN. Receiving care through a PCN was associated with lower rates of ACSC-related hospital admission or emergency department visits for all groups of interest, which suggests that PCNs had similar effects across each group. However, regardless of where care was provided, First Nations and low-SES patients had more than twice the adjusted rates of hospital admission or emergency department visits for diabetes-specific ACSCs than the general population and were less likely to receive guideline-recommended care, including measurement of HbA1c and retinal screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Care in a PCN was associated with lower risks of hospital admission or emergency department visits for diabetes-specific ACSCs, even within vulnerable groups such as First Nations people and those of low SES.

A PCN consists of primary care physicians and allied health care professionals working together to provide care to patients with and without chronic diseases. Funding to PCNs is provided on a capitated basis to support activities that fall outside the fee-for-service model, and these funds may be used to hire the allied health care professionals or for other initiatives, such as developing quality improvement programs for people with chronic diseases, including diabetes. Individual PCNs may take different approaches to chronic disease management, but most use multidisciplinary teams and enhanced patient education.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></p><p>PCNs are postulated to be an effective means of implementing models of chronic disease management.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> In a recent study evaluating the care and outcomes of patients with diabetes, our group documented that care within a PCN was associated with a slightly lower rate of admission to hospital or visits to the emergency department for diabetes-specific ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) and a slightly lower mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> relative to patients outside PCNs, possibly because of the implementation of quality improvement programs within the PCNs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></p><p>Although our previous study suggested that care within PCNs was associated with small improvements in diabetes care for the overall Alberta population, it is not known whether PCNs help to achieve equity of care and outcomes across patient groups, especially those who might traditionally experience difficulties with accessing health care and for whom adverse outcomes are more common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Our objectives for the current study were to determine whether the apparent benefit of PCNs observed in the general population, measured in terms of admissions to hospital and emergency department visits for ACSCs, was also evident for First Nations people and those in lower SES groups and to determine the association between population type and outcomes after adjustment for PCN exposure. We hypothesized that the team-based approach of PCNs might have a more significant impact on care and outcomes for these vulnerable groups than for the general population.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Data sources and study population</title><p>The data sources have been described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> Briefly, for the overall period 1994&#x000a0;Apr.&#x000a0;1 to 2009&#x000a0;Apr.&#x000a0;1, we extracted data on hospital admissions, physician visits, and emergency department visits from Alberta Health and Wellness administrative data files. We also obtained laboratory data from a province-wide repository that captures data for all Albertans who undergo inpatient or outpatient laboratory testing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></p><p>Within these data sources, we used a validated algorithm to define a cohort of adult patients with a diagnosis of diabetes as of 2008&#x000a0;Apr.&#x000a0;1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> A patient was considered to have prevalent diabetes if there were 2 or more physician claims for diabetes (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 9th revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 250) within a period of 2 years, or at least one hospital admission with an ICD-9-CM code of 250, selected from all available diagnostic codes on the patient&#x02019;s hospital discharge abstract, between 1994&#x000a0;Apr.&#x000a0;1 and 2002&#x000a0;Mar.&#x000a0;31, or the equivalent ICD 10th revision (ICD-10) codes (E10&#x02013;E14) from 2002&#x000a0;Apr.&#x000a0;1 to 2008&#x000a0;Apr.&#x000a0;1.

To test for overdispersion, we performed the deviance goodness-of-fit test. Given the presence of overdispersion, we used negative binomial regression models to calculate rate ratios (RRs) and to determine the association between care within a PCN and admission to hospital or visit to an emergency department for a diabetes-specific ACSC. Relevant covariates were identified using backward selection techniques. Final models were adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, presence of hypertension, baseline HbA1c, baseline kidney function (in terms of eGFR), and Charlson comorbidity score. Age, baseline HbA1c, baseline kidney function, and Charlson score were modelled as categorical variables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We used an interaction term (PCN &#x000d7; population type) to determine whether this association varied by population type.</p><p>Given that we also aimed to explore the association between population type and outcomes, we subsequently developed multivariate adjusted models, with population type as the primary exposure, using the general population as the reference group and adjusting for care within a PCN. We used logistic regression to determine the association between population type and dichotomous secondary outcomes (likelihood of HbA1C measurement, retinal screening, and specialist visits), with adjustment as described for our primary analysis. We used negative binomial regression and RRs for the outcome of primary care physician visits. All analyses were performed using STATA 11.0 (Statacorp, College Station, Tex.). This study was approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board of the University of Calgary.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>As of 2008&#x000a0;Apr.&#x000a0;1, we identified 183&#x000a0;654 persons with diabetes. After exclusion of patients 65 years of age and older (n = 77&#x000a0;001), 106 653 patients remained for analysis. Within each population type, those cared for within PCNs were older than those cared for outside of PCNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Baseline glycemic control (as indicated by HbA1c) and renal function (as indicated by eGFR) were generally slightly worse in the non-PCN group across population types. For most population types, the burden of comorbidities was similar for PCN and non-PCN groups, the exception being the health care subsidy group, for which the PCN group was more likely to have hypertension and higher Charlson comorbidity scores.

However, the well-described disparities in quality of care and outcomes persisted for both the Income Support and First Nations cohorts, relative to the general population, even when these patients received care within PCNs.</p><p>PCNs represent Alberta&#x02019;s version of primary care reform, but such reform has also occurred in other Canadian jurisdictions. Ontario has developed several new primary care models to enhance quality and access to care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> These models have focused on changing physician payment from fee-for-service to capitation and providing incentives for provision of multidisciplinary care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref> Alberta&#x02019;s PCNs are most closely aligned with Ontario&#x02019;s Family Health Groups, in that both maintain a fee-for-service model with additional payments per patient enrolled.

Furthermore, their health status generally followed a gradient, with patients receiving the subsidy having worse health than the general population, and those receiving Income Support having worse health than those receiving the subsidy.

For First Nations people, this approach to seeking care may be related to the fact that many live on reserve, where (as noted below) some health care services may be provided through federal programs rather than provincial programs (such as PCNs).</p><p>Our study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, SES was not available for persons 65 years of age or older, as they are all classified as &#x0201c;pensioners&#x0201d; in the Alberta Health and Wellness registry file; as such, people in this age group were excluded from our analysis. Another limitation with this classification system is the lack of income data for the First Nations cohort; as such, we could not determine how their SES compared with that of the non&#x02013;First Nations group. We were also unable to include rurality as a variable within our models, although it may be a relevant covariate for our outcomes of interest. Analyses based on administrative data have well known limitations, including inconsistency or potential unreliability of information available in the hospital discharge abstracts and physician claims data used to estimate the prevalence of comorbid conditions. However, it is unlikely that systematic differences existed in terms of completeness of coding for patients cared for within or outside of a PCN or for patients with different SES levels. Finally, we were unable to identify whether First Nations people were living on or off reserve, a factor that could potentially mask some differences within the First Nations group. This distinction is also important because of its implications for the care people received: on many reserves, diabetes care is supplemented by the Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative (ADI) of Health Canada&#x02019;s First Nations and Inuit Health Branch,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref> care that is not recorded in the Alberta Health and Wellness database. However, although the ADI administers the retinal screening program, all images are read through tele-ophthalmology consultations in which the ophthalmologist is paid on a fee-for-service basis through Alberta Health and Wellness, which would be captured in our data. In contrast, point-of-care measurement of HbA1c administered by the ADI was not captured in the administrative databases that we used; therefore, our results may underestimate HbA1c measurement performed for First Nations individuals living on reserve.</p><p>The use of population-based administrative data is a major strength of this study, because it allowed us to undertake a population-based study of persons with diabetes who were receiving care in Alberta. Furthermore, the ability to combine province-wide laboratory data with information on health care utilization enabled us to assess process-based markers of care, as well as clinically relevant outcomes.</p><p>Care in PCNs was associated with better outcomes for First Nations individuals and those requiring social assistance, but the current model of care does not appear to fully address existing disparities, possibly because chronic disease management programs designed for the general population are less effective in reaching people with lower SES.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref> Patients in the lowest SES group may have other priorities that take precedence over improving how they manage their diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref> Previous studies have suggested that chronic disease management programs for people with low SES may be more effective when specifically tailored to the needs of those populations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref> and certain features of such programs are recommended, including high intensity, long duration, and the incorporation of community outreach and diligent follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></p><p>Consistent with prior work, we noted that care in PCNs was associated with better outcomes (in terms of hospital admission or emergency department visits for diabetes-specific ACSCs) for people with diabetes. Although this difference occurred across all population groups, important disparities in quality of care and outcomes persisted for the highest-risk groups (those receiving Income Support and First Nations individuals, compared with the general population), which suggests that additional programming and different models of care are required for these groups. Future research should focus on implementing and evaluating strategies aimed at improving processes of care and outcomes in these high-risk groups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Competing interests: None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding source: This research was supported by an interdisciplinary team grant from Alberta Innovates &#x02013; Health Solutions, the Interdisciplinary Chronic Disease Collaboration, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (application no. 238543).The funding organizations had no role in the conception, design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, or reporting of the study and had no access to the data.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p>David Campbell, Paul Ronksley, Brenda Hemmelgarn, Marcello Tonelli, and Braden Manns designed the study protocol.
